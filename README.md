# ELISA-clanganalyzer
The Clang Static Analyzer is a source code analysis tool that finds bugs in C, C++, and Objective-C programs.  Currently it can be run either from the command line or if you use macOS then within Xcode. When invoked from the command line, it is intended to be run in tandem with a build of a codebase.  The analyzer is 100% open source and is part of the Clang project. Like the rest of Clang, the analyzer is implemented as a C++ library that can be used by other tools and applications.
